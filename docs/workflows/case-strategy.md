```

### Step 3: Risk Probability Assessment

**Goal**: Quantify litigation risks with evidence-based probabilities

**Query Format**:
```
"Calculate probability of success for [claim] considering [factors]"
```

**Example**:
```
"Calculate probability of success considering:
- Strong breach evidence (90% confidence)
- Foreseeability issue (BGE 144 III 93 precedent against us)
- Defendant's force majeure defense (moderately plausible)
- Damage amount: CHF 300,000 claimed"

Expected Response:
RISK PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:

Probability Tree Analysis:

1. LIABILITY PHASE:
   ├─ Breach Proven: 90% probability
   │  └─ Clear evidence, strong documentation
   │
   ├─ Force Majeure Defense Fails: 70% probability
   │  └─ BGE precedent: Force majeure requires impossibility, not difficulty
   │  └─ COVID-19 alone insufficient per BGE 147 III 65
   │
   └─ Liability Established: 63% (90% × 70%)

2. DAMAGES PHASE (Given Liability):
   ├─ Foreseeability Proven: 50% probability
   │  └─ BGE 144 III 93: Strict standard
   │  └─ Contract silence problematic
   │
   ├─ Damage Amount Accepted: 80% probability
   │  └─ Good documentation
   │  └─ Causation clear
   │
   └─ Full Damages Awarded: 40% (50% × 80%)

3. COMBINED PROBABILITY:
   Overall Success (Liability + Full Damages): 25% (63% × 40%)
   Partial Success (Liability + Reduced Damages): 45%
   Complete Failure: 30%

EXPECTED VALUE CALCULATION:
Full Recovery (CHF 300,000): 25% × CHF 300,000 = CHF 75,000
Partial Recovery (CHF 150,000): 45% × CHF 150,000 = CHF 67,500
No Recovery: 30% × CHF 0 = CHF 0

Expected Value: CHF 142,500

MINUS Litigation Costs:
Court Fees + Attorney Fees (estimated): CHF 50,000-75,000
Net Expected Value: CHF 67,500-92,500

RECOMMENDATION: Settlement negotiations advisable given risk profile

### Step 4: Procedural Strategy Development

**Goal**: Optimize procedural approach for best strategic outcome

**Query Format**:
```
"What procedural options do we have for [case type] in [jurisdiction]?"
```

**Example**:
```
"What procedural options for CHF 500,000 breach of contract claim
in Zürich Commercial Court?"

Expected Response:
PROCEDURAL STRATEGY OPTIONS:

1. ORDINARY PROCEDURE (Recommended):

   Applicable Law: ZPO + ZH cantonal implementing provisions

   Timeline:
   - Complaint filing → Service: 2-4 weeks
   - Answer deadline: 20 days (Art. 222 ZPO)
   - Exchange of evidence: 2-4 months
   - Main hearing: 6-9 months from filing
   - Judgment: 3-6 months after hearing
   - Total: 12-18 months

   Strategic Advantages:
   ✅ Full evidentiary development
   ✅ Multiple procedural opportunities
   ✅ Professional judges (commercial expertise)
   ✅ Structured settlement discussions

   Tactical Considerations:
   - File comprehensive complaint with evidence
   - Request early evidence preservation (Art. 158 ZPO)
   - Consider preliminary measures if needed

2. SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE (Strategic Alternative):

   Timing: Can request at any time (Art. 213 ZPO)

   Advantages:
   ✅ Cost savings (CHF 25,000-50,000 vs. full litigation)
   ✅ Time savings (3-6 months vs. 12-18 months)
   ✅ Confidentiality maintained
   ✅ Creative solutions possible

   Strategic Approach:
   - Demand: CHF 300,000 (full damages)
   - Target: CHF 200,000-250,000 (67-83% recovery)
   - Walk-away: CHF 150,000 (50% recovery)
   - Rationale: Foreseeability risk justifies discount

3. PRELIMINARY MEASURES (If Applicable):

   Available under Art. 261 ZPO if:
   - Defendant threatening asset dissipation
   - Evidence at risk of destruction
   - Irreparable harm imminent

   Options:
   - Provisional seizure (Arrest, Art. 271 ZPO)
   - Protective measures (Schutzmassnahmen, Art. 262 ZPO)
   - Evidence preservation (Beweissicherung, Art. 158 ZPO)

RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:
Phase 1: File comprehensive complaint with settlement offer
Phase 2: Participate in mandatory settlement conference
Phase 3: If settlement fails, proceed to full litigation

### Step 5: Settlement Value Calculation

**Goal**: Determine appropriate settlement range based on risk analysis

**Query Format**:
```
"Calculate settlement value for [case] considering [risk factors and costs]"
```

**Example**:
```
"Calculate settlement range considering:
- Expected value: CHF 142,500
- Litigation costs: CHF 50,000-75,000
- Time value: 12-18 months to judgment
- Risk factors: Foreseeability uncertainty, force majeure defense"

Expected Response:
SETTLEMENT VALUE ANALYSIS:

1. ECONOMIC CALCULATION:

   Best Case Scenario:
   - Full recovery: CHF 300,000
   - Minus litigation costs: CHF 75,000
   - Net recovery: CHF 225,000
   - Probability: 25%

   Base Case Scenario:
   - Partial recovery: CHF 150,000
   - Minus litigation costs: CHF 62,500
   - Net recovery: CHF 87,500
   - Probability: 45%

   Worst Case Scenario:
   - No recovery: CHF 0
   - Minus sunk litigation costs: CHF 50,000
   - Net loss: CHF 50,000
   - Probability: 30%

   Weighted Expected Value:
   (25% × CHF 225,000) + (45% × CHF 87,500) + (30% × -CHF 50,000)
   = CHF 56,250 + CHF 39,375 - CHF 15,000
   = CHF 80,625

2. TIME VALUE ADJUSTMENT:

   Opportunity cost of capital (12-18 months @ 3% discount rate):
   Present value adjustment: -5% to -7%
   Adjusted expected value: CHF 75,000-77,000

3. NON-ECONOMIC FACTORS:

   Business Relationship: Negative (ongoing supplier)
   Reputational Risk: Moderate (industry knowledge)
   Management Time: High (C-level involvement)

   Adjustment: -10% to -15%

4. SETTLEMENT RANGE RECOMMENDATION:

   Maximum Settlement Demand: CHF 250,000 (83% of claim)
   Target Settlement: CHF 180,000-200,000 (60-67% of claim)
   Minimum Acceptable: CHF 125,000 (42% of claim)
   Walk-Away Point: CHF 100,000 (33% of claim)

   Rationale:
   - Reflects 25-30% discount for foreseeability risk
   - Accounts for litigation cost savings
   - Values time and business relationship
   - Above net expected value with full litigation

NEGOTIATION STRATEGY:
Opening Offer: CHF 275,000 (91% - leaves negotiation room)
Fallback Positions: CHF 250,000 → CHF 200,000 → CHF 150,000
Final Position: CHF 125,000 minimum

## Strategic Decision Framework

### When to Litigate

✅ **Proceed with Litigation** if:
- Probability of success >70% on liability
- Expected value >2x litigation costs
- Non-economic factors support litigation
- Settlement negotiations failed at reasonable value
- Precedent-setting value for client's business

### When to Settle

✅ **Pursue Settlement** if:
- Foreseeability or other significant legal risks
- Litigation costs approach expected recovery
- Business relationship worth preserving
- Defendant has credible defenses
- Time to judgment problematic for client

### When to Walk Away

✅ **Abandon Claim** if:
- Probability of success <30%
- Expected value negative
- Defendant judgment-proof
- Costs exceed maximum possible recovery
- Reputational risks outweigh benefits

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:

1. **Quantify Everything**: Convert qualitative assessments to probabilities
2. **Update Continuously**: Reassess strategy as new evidence emerges
3. **Consider Costs**: Factor in all litigation expenses
4. **Think Long-Term**: Evaluate precedent and relationship impacts
5. **Document Decisions**: Record strategic choices for client communication

### ❌ Don't:

1. **Over-Optimize**: Don't chase marginal probability improvements
2. **Ignore Emotions**: Client psychology matters in settlement
3. **Neglect Alternatives**: Always consider non-litigation options
4. **Underestimate Costs**: Litigation always costs more than estimated
5. **Forget Business Context**: Legal wins may be business losses

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Strong Case, Weak Defendant

**Situation**: High probability of success but defendant financially unstable

**Strategy**:
- Pursue preliminary asset seizure (Art. 271 ZPO)
- Accelerate proceedings
- Prioritize early settlement before insolvency
- Consider partial settlement for immediate payment

### Scenario 2: Weak Case, Sympathetic Facts

**Situation**: Legal case marginal but facts favor client

**Strategy**:
- Emphasize factual narrative in pleadings
- Request lay judge participation if available
- Prepare strong opening statement for oral hearing
- Highlight equitable considerations (Art. 4 ZGB)

### Scenario 3: Complex Case, High Stakes

**Situation**: Novel legal issues, significant amount in controversy

**Strategy**:
- Invest in comprehensive legal research
- Consider expert witnesses for complex issues
- Build detailed evidentiary record
- Prepare for potential appeals (BGE precedent-setting)
