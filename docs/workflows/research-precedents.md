- **Full Research Report**: 2-3 hours (detailed analysis with multiple sources)

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Goal**: Clearly articulate what you need to research

**Best Practices**:
- Be specific about the legal issue
- Identify relevant statutes (Art. X OR/ZGB/StGB)
- Specify jurisdiction (federal or cantonal)
- Note any known precedents

**Example Research Questions**:
```
❌ Too Vague: "What does Swiss law say about contracts?"

✅ Specific: "What are the BGE precedents on liability for breach of
   contract under Art. 97 OR, specifically regarding calculation of
   damages and foreseeability requirements?"

✅ Focused: "Find recent BGE decisions (last 5 years) on good faith
   principle under Art. 2 ZGB in the context of contract interpretation"
```

### Step 2: Initial BGE Precedent Search

**Activation**: Use research-triggering keywords

**Query Format**:
```
"Search BGE for [legal topic] under [statute reference]"
```

**Examples**:

**Federal Law Research**:
```
"Search BGE for contractual liability under Art. 97 OR"

Expected Response:
🎭 Persona: Legal Researcher
📖 Mode: Federal Law
🇨🇭 Jurisdiction: Swiss Federal Law

BGE Precedents on Art. 97 OR Contractual Liability:

1. BGE 144 III 93
   - Topic: Breach of contract, calculation of damages
   - Key Holding: Damages must be foreseeable at contract formation
   - Relevance: Establishes foreseeability test for Art. 97 OR

2. BGE 142 III 102
   - Topic: Breach of contract, burden of proof
   - Key Holding: Creditor must prove breach and damages
   - Relevance: Clarifies evidentiary requirements

```

**Cantonal Law Research**:
```
"Search for Zürich cantonal court decisions on commercial lease disputes"

Expected Response:
🎭 Persona: Legal Researcher
📖 Mode: Cantonal Law (ZH)
🏛️ Canton: Zürich

Zürich Obergericht Decisions on Commercial Leases:
[Cantonal precedents with proper citations...]
```

**Multi-Lingual Research**:
```
Query in French: "Rechercher des ATF sur la responsabilité contractuelle
selon l'art. 97 CO"

Expected Response:
🎭 Persona: Legal Researcher
📖 Mode: Multi-Lingual (FR)
🌐 Languages: FR (primary), DE/IT (cross-reference)

ATF sur la responsabilité contractuelle (art. 97 CO):
[French language analysis with proper terminology...]
```

### Step 3: Deep Dive into Specific Precedents

**Goal**: Understand key holdings and legal principles

**Query Format**:
```
"Explain the key holding in BGE [citation]"
"What does BGE [citation] say about [specific issue]?"
```

**Example**:
```
"Explain the key holding in BGE 144 III 93"

Expected Response:
BGE 144 III 93 - Breach of Contract and Foreseeability

Facts:
- Software development contract breach
- Contractor failed to deliver on time
- Creditor claimed CHF 200,000 in consequential damages

Legal Issue:
Whether consequential business losses are recoverable under Art. 97 OR
when not explicitly mentioned in contract

Holding:
1. Damages must be foreseeable at time of contract formation (Art. 97 OR)
2. Foreseeability assessed from perspective of reasonable contracting party
3. Special circumstances requiring disclosure if not apparent

Reasoning:
- Federal Supreme Court applied strict foreseeability test
- Contract silent on potential business losses = not foreseeable
- Burden on creditor to demonstrate foreseeability

Precedent Value:
- Authoritative interpretation of Art. 97 OR foreseeability requirement
- Widely cited in subsequent commercial contract cases
- Clarifies distinction between direct and consequential damages

```

### Step 4: Compare and Contrast Precedents

**Goal**: Understand evolution of legal doctrine

**Query Format**:
```
"Compare BGE [citation 1] with BGE [citation 2] on [issue]"
```

**Example**:
```
"Compare BGE 144 III 93 with BGE 140 III 86 on the foreseeability
requirement under Art. 97 OR"

Expected Response:
Comparative Analysis: BGE 144 III 93 vs. BGE 140 III 86

Common Ground:
✅ Both apply foreseeability test from Art. 97 OR
✅ Both assess from perspective of reasonable contracting party
✅ Both require foreseeability at time of contract formation

Key Differences:

BGE 144 III 93 (2018):
- Strict application of foreseeability test
- Emphasized contract silence as evidence of non-foreseeability
- Burden of proof on creditor to demonstrate special circumstances

BGE 140 III 86 (2014):
- More flexible foreseeability standard
- Industry practices considered in assessment
- Held that professional parties should foresee typical business risks

Doctrinal Evolution:
The Federal Supreme Court appeared to tighten the foreseeability
standard between 2014 and 2018, placing greater emphasis on
express contractual provisions.

Practice Implications:
- Draft contracts with explicit damage limitation clauses
- Document special circumstances and potential risks
- Cannot rely solely on industry standards for foreseeability

### Step 5: Statutory Analysis and Interpretation

**Goal**: Understand statutory requirements and judicial interpretation

**Query Format**:
```
"Explain the requirements of Art. [X] [Statute]"
"How do courts interpret Art. [X] [Statute]?"
```

**Example**:
```
"Explain the requirements for liability under Art. 41 OR"

Expected Response:
Art. 41 OR - Tort Liability Requirements

Statutory Text:
Art. 41 Abs. 1 OR:
"Whoever unlawfully causes damage to another, whether intentionally
or negligently, is liable to provide compensation."

Four Cumulative Requirements:

1. UNLAWFUL ACT (Widerrechtlichkeit / illicéité / illiceità)
   Definition: Violation of absolute rights or statutory duty
   BGE Authority: BGE 144 III 394
   - Includes property, personality rights, freedom
   - Breach of statutory duty even without damage to absolute right
   - Good faith consideration per Art. 2 ZGB

2. DAMAGE (Schaden / dommage / danno)
   Definition: Involuntary diminution of net worth
   BGE Authority: BGE 143 III 101
   - Must be actual, not merely potential
   - Includes property damage, economic loss, non-pecuniary damage
   - Calculated as difference between hypothetical and actual position

3. CAUSAL CONNECTION (Kausalzusammenhang / lien de causalité / nesso causale)
   Two-Part Test:
   a) Natural Causation: Condicio sine qua non (but-for test)
   b) Adequate Causation: Act must be generally suitable to cause harm

   BGE Authority: BGE 143 III 228
   - Natural causation: Would damage have occurred without act?
   - Adequate causation: Probability assessment, not mere possibility

4. FAULT (Verschulden / faute / colpa)
   Standard: Intent or negligence
   BGE Authority: BGE 142 III 433
   - Intent: Knowledge and will to cause damage
   - Negligence: Failure to exercise required care
   - Burden of proof on plaintiff (Art. 8 ZGB)

### Step 6: Citation Verification and Formatting

**Goal**: Ensure citation accuracy and proper formatting

**Query Format**:
```
"Verify the citation BGE [volume] [section] [page]"
"Format this citation in [language]"
```

**Example**:
```
"Verify the citation BGE 144 III 93 and provide proper format in
German, French, and Italian"

Expected Response:

```

**Example Output Structure**:
```
LEGAL RESEARCH MEMORANDUM

TO: [Attorney Name]
FROM: BetterCallClaude Legal Research
RE: Contractual Liability and Foreseeability of Damages (Art. 97 OR)
DATE: [Current Date]

ISSUE PRESENTED:
Whether consequential business losses from breach of software development
contract are recoverable under Art. 97 OR when not expressly mentioned
in the contract.

BRIEF ANSWER:
No. Under current BGE precedent (BGE 144 III 93), consequential damages
must be foreseeable at the time of contract formation. Absent express
contractual provisions or special circumstances disclosed during
negotiations, consequential business losses are generally not recoverable.

APPLICABLE LAW:
- Art. 97 OR (Breach of Contract - Liability in General)
- BGE 144 III 93 (Foreseeability requirement - strict application)
- BGE 140 III 86 (Foreseeability - flexible standard)

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Boolean Search Strategies

Combine multiple search terms for precision:

```
"Search BGE for decisions involving BOTH Art. 97 OR AND Art. 41 OR
(concurrent contractual and tort liability)"
```

### Technique 2: Temporal Analysis

Track doctrinal evolution over time:

```
"Show me the evolution of BGE precedents on Art. 2 ZGB good faith
principle from 2010 to present"
```

### Technique 3: Cross-Jurisdictional Research

Compare federal and cantonal approaches:

```
"Compare federal BGE precedents on commercial lease disputes with
Zürich cantonal court decisions on the same topic"
```

### Technique 4: Multilingual Term Mapping

Ensure terminology consistency across languages:

```
"Provide the German, French, and Italian equivalents for
'breach of contract' and cite relevant BGE precedents in each language"
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with general topic search, refine based on results
2. **Verify All Citations**: Always verify BGE citations against bundesgericht.ch
3. **Note Precedent Hierarchy**: BGE > Cantonal courts > Administrative authorities
4. **Track Recent Developments**: Focus on recent precedents (last 5-10 years)
5. **Document Your Research**: Save queries and responses for future reference
6. **Cross-Reference Languages**: Use multi-lingual search to find additional precedents

### ❌ Don't:

1. **Over-Rely on Summaries**: Read full BGE decisions for critical cases
2. **Ignore Cantonal Law**: Federal law doesn't cover everything
3. **Skip Citation Verification**: Unverified citations can undermine legal arguments
4. **Neglect Doctrinal Commentary**: BGE precedents should be read with scholarly analysis
5. **Forget Update Checks**: Law evolves - verify precedents are still good law
