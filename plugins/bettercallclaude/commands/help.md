## Tips

1. Be specific: "Art. 97 OR foreseeability" is better than "contract damages".
2. Include citations: Reference articles and BGE numbers when you have them.
3. Specify jurisdiction: Mention the canton for cantonal law questions.
4. Choose language: Query in your preferred language (DE/FR/IT/EN).
5. Use workflows: For complex matters, let the gateway coordinate multiple agents.
