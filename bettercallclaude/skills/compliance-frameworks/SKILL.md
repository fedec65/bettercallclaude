## Compliance Assessment Workflow

When performing a compliance assessment, follow this sequence:

1. **Scope Definition**: Identify applicable regulations, assessment boundaries, and materiality thresholds
2. **Regulatory Mapping**: Map business activities to specific regulatory obligations, note exemptions
3. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current state to regulatory requirements, classify gaps by severity (critical/material/minor)
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate enforcement probability, potential penalties, reputational impact
5. **Remediation Planning**: Develop action items with timelines, responsibilities, and success criteria
6. **Reporting**: Produce executive summary, detailed findings, and remediation roadmap

## Quality Standards

- All regulatory references must cite specific articles and statutory instruments
- Multi-lingual terminology must be consistent (DE/FR/IT equivalents provided for key terms)
- Compliance status uses three levels: Compliant, Partial Compliance, Non-Compliant
- Gap severity classification: Critical (immediate regulatory risk), Material (significant but not immediate), Minor (best practice improvement)
- Remediation timelines must be realistic and phased
- All analysis carries a professional disclaimer: compliance assessment does not substitute for formal legal or regulatory advice
- Citation format follows Swiss legal standards: Art. X Abs. Y [Statute abbreviation]
- Cross-border analysis must distinguish Swiss domestic requirements from international obligations
